# Computer_Visuals_Graphics_Portfolio

This repository represents the work done for several assignments related to the concepts and foundations of Computer Graphics and Visualization!

How do I approach designing software? What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? What design process did you follow for your project work? How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

One way to write programs that achieve maintainability, readability and adaptibility is by adhering to a consistent coding style that meets the expectations of established standards. By doing this, I'd be writing code that is understood universally by others and allows for the easy detection of errors within a program. Another way to accomplish maintainability, readability and adaptibility is through incorporating user feedback and user stories. By prioritizing user feedback and user stories, programmers are can center the programs design on these needs, rather than to have a loose idea of what they aim to achieve. Lastly, to write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable for users by focusing on creating simplistic and modular operations to regulate these considerations, hence utitilizing the CRUD methodology for development. Utilizing the CRUD methodology helped to connect functionalities with the database without knowing the all details about it. CRUD also allowed for seamless integration for the front-end develop due to the ability of reusing CRUD operations.

One advantage of working with is CRUD is that offers modularity within the program. With modularity, programmers are able to modify parts of a system without directly effecting the entire script. Which prevents confusion and promotes efficiency in writing programs in the long-run of a software's lifespan. Another advantage of working with CRUD is that it provides a standardized structure. With a standardized structure, it makes it easier for users to adapt to the way the code is structured and used, ultimately simplifying troubleshooting and updating code. Lastly, this CRUD Python module can be used in the future to develop content management websites. This due to how the basic functionality of content management websites mimics the functions of create, read, update and delete in a database management.

How do I approach developing programs? What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? How did iteration factor into your development? How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?


How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Computer science can help me reach my goals because it allows for the innovation and growth in various industries that benefit the general public in unique ways. This variety in computer science allows for the growth of society to grow build on prior foundations to continue improving the lives of others. Computational graphics and visualizations give me new knowledge skills that can be applied in future educational pathways as now I can identify many aspects of graphics and visualization such as lightining, texture, shape creation, etc., and apply it to other classes to further expand what I know. Computational graphics and visualizations give me new knowledge skills that can be applied in future professional pathways as I can use my skills in a professional environment that revolves around developing interactive experiences, 3D simulations for companies and video games. I can also use these skills for appealing UI elements for some applications.
